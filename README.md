# hawkes
hawkes processes for diversification models

main functions 

-> likelihood for branching times under the hawkes model (potentially multidimentional) 

-> simulate branching times under a Hawkes model

-> construct a phylogeny from a set of branching times


-> fit different pure birth diversification models
